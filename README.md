# HelloWorld

This repository is the first trial repository of Michael An.

### 2018.01

I start to learn front-end development. There are plenty of differences between traditional webpage editing (such as using Adobe Dreamweaver software to design a webpage).

The new standards of HTML5 and CSS3 are amazing. These parts are easy , I think. Probablly because I can use photoshop, firework and other Adobe softwares fluentlly.

What's more, it is easy to use css. But using it well isn't an easy task.

### 2018.02

learning basic javascript codes. Basic JS codes are similar to other coding languages. JS is an O-O programming language. The polymorphism isn't obvious.

ECMAscript, a standard coding plan, is developing rapidly. ES5 is ripe and stable. In 2015, ES6 use class to create an object (from cpp?). And ES6 use string module. It maybe come from Ruby.

Recently some frineds told me that NodeJS could work in desktop application. In one day JS will work every place.

### 2018.03

I got a github account. Learning git is an essential step. When I fell asleep, I find that writing and coding could make me patient and calm.

I find a project, Codecombat. Codecombat is a perfect open-source project. It uses coffeeScript rather than javascript. A little upset => => In this project, people can learn coding including Python, Javascript, Java and other languages.

Learing coding and English every day!

### 2018.04

Read readme.text of data repository. Finish user's information setting in github.

I can make a basic webpage using sublime editor. HTML is the structure of pages, CSS is the style of pages, JS is the magic and action of pages.

Other small JS plug-ins can help me to ease working stress. The fullpage plug-in can make different pages switching fluently. And a small shopping project (similar to JD) and a take-out meal project are finished.

### 2018.05

laern senior javascript programming. And JS is not easy. Some JS codes are unique. Such as 0.1 plus 0.2 not equal 0.3, however, 0.1 plus 0.5 equal 0.6. And ajax is excellent. Now axios can work well without ajax.

In the free time, I learn about main structures and MVC or MVVM design modal. (Modal-View-View-Modal). The main structures are Angular, Vue and React. Recently, Angular is too large to design a single page, so people choose React or Vue. And I design three shopping webpages for mobile devices. The pages use different methods to suit different length and height(percentage, flex, rem). Now I should use it fluently.

### 2018.06

Continue learning structue. Using modals can save more time and make codes use widely. Start designing Leisure website and a company fullpage. We have a small team and my main job is to design webpages. And I need to test my codes with others groupnumbers. There are many bugs that we can't realise until testing together. And sometimes designer perfer another color or logo, I need to clip them right away. The jobs are interesting and busy. Tired but happy.

And I learn some chrome inside render methods. There are three engines and each engines can render diferent parts of webpage. There are much knowledge that I need to learn. As a developing front-end develper, I have to know Internet basic and data structure knowledge as quickly as I can.

### 2018.07

I start to learn Mina frame for WeChat small app. I have a personal Wechat Official Platform. In one day, I will design my own WeChat Small App by myself.

The Mina frame use different programming language, wxml and wxss. Wxml language uses different tags(such as View tag). Wxss use different length, rpx, rather than px or percentage methods. This frame has many useful modules and we can easily use the APIs. However, data tramsfer by using props and state is not easy for me.

Never stop coding!

### 2018.08

August is a very busy month. Not only did I finish so mush codes of html, css, js, but also I learn plenty of new knowledge points. To be honest, I didn't have one day rest. At night I always learn new grammar. And there are some details about August.

#### 1. Do some unit test.

It is significant to do unit test before using a new javascript API. When we finished writing an API, we must test it right away. The main test tool are Mocha or Jest. Using assertions to test if the API could return a right value. Unit test is basic test.

The basic method is test APIs one by one. The advanced method is test lots of APIs once. Using one result as other API's parameters. But you should make sure that most of APIs are right and can return what you want. If there are some errors or warnings, you should check them one by one.

For a fresh bird, I choose the first method now. In the future, I will use the advanced methods to release my work pressure and deal with other projects. Time is precious.

#### 2. learn new OS（operating system）

I heard MAC OS and Linux OS before. But I didn't operate them before. Now I need to learn the basic knowledge. The Linux system is much different from Windows system. I use Ubuntu, a special linux OS. The base and vim command line need to remember. In the future, I will use them much. Bye-Bye windows.

Till now I can't find adequate PS and other softwares in MAC. I didn't have an Apple ID so I can't down app from App Store. The NodeJS and NPM parts are useful in MAC. I still use sublime as my editor software. The webstorm and atom editor are useful too.

#### 3. new knowledge of Jest

What's more, there are many new knowledge points. I need to learn reactstrap(bootstrap in react framework). The ECMAscript6 is necessary. The differences between const and let (let use much memory than const, about 2% to 3% maybe). And array function is useful. It can bind this to using function automaticly.Others, learn button/DropDown/Modal compoennts of reactstrap.

React framework contains several life cycle fucntion. How to use them fluently needs much time to practice.

And slate.js framework, a rich text framework, is also important.

Map Object/Selectiom/Value/Change and ... blob file

write later because there are much things to deal now.

### 2018.09

plan: learn slate.js (the main APIs) and react framework step by step. Hurry up!

And this is the first time to use vim to write readme.md And use it more.

There are so many things to learn. And I found that it is important for us to learn not only code basic using but also inner logic of basic. For instance, learning slate-core codes is significant for understanding lower codes logic.

And I learn code (JS) data structure of JS. The bacis data strcuture is Array. In JS, we can use Array to create other complex data structure. (queue/stack/linked chart). What's more, the basic network knowledge is also essential and basic.  


### 2018.10

For a front-end engineer, I should use front-end technique fluently. The main structure and basic logic and data structure. And I thought that I should not only know my aspects but also learn other aspects. The basic   network and back-end knowledge are also important. I needn't write back-end codes, I just know their methods and thoughts. And I should learn front-end parts firstly. 

Recently work is not busy (compared with Sep). And there are other things I have to deal with, such as tax, insurance, family tree : ) I will spend at least 20 percentages of my time and monty into future development (books and other online lecture). Never give up! Just hurry up!
